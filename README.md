# JS211_Address-Book

# DONE Create a new repo (name it descriptively well), clone it to your local machine and share it with your partner

# Open the directory and create an index.html and main.js file to fetch a user and display them one at at time

Use the API: https://randomuser.me/api/ to fetch a user now
function to perform a basic fetch

Fetch a new user multiple times and store them in an array
Function:
    variable for the fetches
    call fetch n number of times
    add results to variable
    fetch/add, fetch/add, ...

Then list out all the users in your address book array by name and picture
Function:
map()
loop

Figure out how to fetch multiple users in one fetch request
Main Fetch Function
/?results-10

Fetch multiple users on window load
I want to run the main fetch function when the html page loads in the window

window.loag(mainFunction()) first line of my js

DOM
window -- browser
document -- web page
elements -- stuff on the web page

Add a button to each user that when clicked displays the rest of their information like DOB, address and so forth
w3schools howto js toggle hide show

in js,
create a button element
create event listener
change the button ckass to show/hide extra info








Once you have the functionality working, feel free to style and structure your address book with CSS and HTML
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL OF THIS BY NOW. TRUST YOURSELF!!

Push Yourself Further
Display your users alphabetically
Add another button to hide the information
Request only users from AU, then US, then FR and then GB
Figure out how to only request name, picture and cell
Figure out how to exclude: dob, registered, nationality, location

ABSOLUTELY THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD DO:

Style your address book with some flare by adding a CSS file
